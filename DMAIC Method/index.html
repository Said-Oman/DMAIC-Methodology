          <h2>Define: Defining the Problem and Project Goals</h2>
          <p>The Define stage is the first step in the DMAIC Method. It involves clearly defining the problem or
              opportunity and establishing the project goals. This stage sets the foundation for the entire
              improvement project.</p>
          <p>During this stage, it is essential to gather relevant data, identify the stakeholders, and define the
              project scope. It is crucial to have a clear understanding of the current state and the desired
              future state to set achievable goals and objectives.</p>
          <p>The Define stage provides a roadmap for the rest of the DMAIC process and helps ensure that the
              improvement efforts align with the organization's strategic objectives.</p>

  <section id="section2" data-nav="Measure">
    <div class="landing__container">
        <h2>Measure: Measuring and Gathering Data</h2>
        <p>In the Measure stage, the focus is on collecting data related to the problem identified in the Define
            stage. This data provides a baseline for evaluating the current performance and helps identify the
            root causes of the problem.</p>
        <p>During this stage, various measurement techniques are employed, such as data collection plans,
            sampling methods, and statistical analysis. The goal is to gather accurate and reliable data to
            support the analysis and decision-making process.</p>
        <p>The Measure stage helps quantify the problem, identify process variations, and establish a solid
            foundation for data-driven decision making in subsequent stages.</p>

<section id="section3" data-nav="Analyze">
    <div class="landing__container">
        <h2>Analyze: Analyzing and Identifying Root Causes</h2>
        <p>The Analyze stage involves analyzing the data collected in the Measure stage to identify the root
            causes of the problem. This stage aims to understand the underlying factors contributing to the
            issue.</p>
        <p>Various analysis techniques, such as cause-and-effect diagrams, Pareto charts, and hypothesis testing,
            are used to identify potential causes and prioritize them based on their impact.</p>
        <p>The Analyze stage helps organizations gain insights into the problem and determine the critical areas
            that require improvement. It provides a deeper understanding of the processes and helps identify
            potential solutions.</p>
    </div>
</section>
<section id="section4" data-nav="Improve">
    <div class="landing__container">
        <h2>Improve: Implementing Solutions and Evaluating Results</h2>
        <p>The Improve stage focuses on developing and implementing solutions to address the root causes
            identified in the Analyze stage. This stage aims to improve the process and eliminate or mitigate
            the identified issues.</p>
        <p>During this stage, potential solutions are generated, evaluated, and selected. Piloting and testing
            are conducted to assess the effectiveness of the proposed solutions. Once the optimal solution is
            identified, it is implemented, and the results are monitored and evaluated.</p>
        <p>The Improve stage aims to achieve significant improvements and optimize the process to meet the
            desired goals and objectives.</p>
    </div>
</section>
<section id="section5" data-nav="Control">
    <div class="landing__container">
        <h2>Control: Implementing Controls and Sustaining Improvements</h2>
        <p>The Control stage focuses on implementing controls and sustaining the improvements achieved in the
            Improve stage. It aims to ensure that the improvements are sustained in the long term and become
            part of the standard operating procedures.</p>
        <p>In this stage, control measures, such as standard operating procedures, performance metrics, and
            ongoing monitoring, are established. Training and communication plans are developed to ensure
            employees understand their roles and responsibilities in maintaining the improvements.</p>
        <p>The Control stage helps organizations prevent the recurrence of the problem and continuously monitor
            the process to ensure its stability and effectiveness.</p>
